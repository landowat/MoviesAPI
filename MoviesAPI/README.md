Creating an API using C#, .NET, Entity Framework, and LINQ

Developed a robust and scalable API using C# and .NET. 
Leveraged Entity Framework for efficient database interactions and LINQ for sophisticated data queries. 
The API supports CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization. Implemented best practices in API development, including clean architecture, 
proper error handling, and comprehensive testing. Integrated Swagger for API documentation and Azure for cloud deployment.
